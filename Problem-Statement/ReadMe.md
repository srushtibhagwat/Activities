<h1>Logic for ProblemStatement1.js</h1>
  
  <h5>First I declared a variable called res which will hold the maximum water value. 
  After that I declared the for loop for every element of an array except first and the last element. 
  I used the two pointer concept here i.e left and the right to get the maximum water value. 
  After that I found the maximum element using max function on the left then I compared it with the right. 
  To get the res value I found the minimum value between left and right and then subtracted it with the initial arr[i] i.e prev value and added it to res to get the updated res. 
  So here, we got the maximum water value.
